## How to Run
Open the folder GithubGraphics2 in Unity 2020.3.26f1 (although it should be compatible with other versions of Unity 2020). To run the game in the editor, open the MainScene in Assets/_Project/Scenes. To compile into an executable, open the Build Settings menu, choose the proper platform (PC, Mac & Linux Standalone) and select Build button. Make sure the MainScene is included in Scenes In Build in the build menu.
